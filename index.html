          <h3>IMAGINE</h3>
          If there is anything you want in life, it all starts with imagination. You have to think it first to provide a vision. Once you have that vision, hold tight, and dig deeper. The vision is far from reach, but you dream it anyway. You feel like it’s all just a dream and something you can only fathom. Ever since grade school, adults said to put our “thinking caps” on and imagine what could, should, or would happen. It’s never too late to retrieve those caps. Imagine what you want in life and hold tight. It’s the perfect start to making your dreams a reality.

        <div id="innovate-txt">
          <h3>INNOVATE</h3>
          Take that imagination and start to build on it. Make it a reality. Actively seek ideas on how to best create this dream. Envision what’s in your head and translate that with a pen on paper. However you decide to approach this is up to you, but it all starts with innovation. Get crafty and think of ways to put the pieces together. If one approach didn’t work for you, that doesn’t mean you’re a failure. It just means that approach simply did not work. Get your hands dirty and think of alternative solutions. There is never one right answer - just many possible solutions.

          <h3>INFLUENCE</h3>
          Think of what influences you in life - friends, family members, coaches, etc. Who do you idolize and why do you admire them? Could it be the things they do, the words they say, or the emotions they feel? There are many ways someone or something can impact your life. Take those influential thoughts and put them into action. It will help to show that your dreams come from a genuine place of understanding yourself as well as those around you. Certain things influence you for a reason. Use those as a trigger to impact others, as well.

        <div id="inspire-txt">
          <h3>INSPIRE</h3>
          Now that you’ve made your dream a reality, go out and inspire others. Show them that they are able to achieve anything in life. Be the inspiration to them as others were to you. It won’t be easy, but it will definitely be worth it. Everything in life is a learning experience and you will get something out of it one way or another. Inspire people with optimism, encouragement, and endless possibilities in achieving dreams. You start life small - a tiny baby dependent on everyone but yourself. As you grow and experience more in life, you will be able to depend on yourself more, find inspiration, and eventually inspire others.
